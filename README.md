# README

This is the repo for my workthrough of Go Rail's [Rails for Beginners](https://gorails.com/series/rails-6-for-beginners) course. Unfortunately, at 53% progress through the material, it has become clear that the course's dependence on the now-benighted Twitter API (and easy `omniauth` integration with it) would make continued progress very challenging, and not worth the time and energy commitment. I'll be moving across to the new Rails 7 material instead.
